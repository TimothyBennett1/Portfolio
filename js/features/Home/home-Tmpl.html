            I am a MEAN stack developer with an eye for design. My goal is to build functional UI/UX experiences with great design. I just recently graduated from the Immersive Web course at
            DevMountain, and before that, I was in the United States Army. I am excited to keep on learning more and growing my experience.

            I was raised in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I was always excited to solve new problems, and I fell in love with Web Development. I joined the United States Armed Forces when I was 25 as
            an Infantryman. It was an awesome experience but, I felt I needed to expend myself. The only other thing that I wanted to do was Web Development. So, I joined Devmountain to better what
            little knowledge I had. Devmountain was a great experience and taught me the skills I needed to grow in this field. I am currently seeking employment. If you have any questions or want to
            say Hi, you can contact me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothybennett2">Linkedin</a>.

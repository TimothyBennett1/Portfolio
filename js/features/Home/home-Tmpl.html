  <div class="home-content-about">
    <p>I was raised in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I was always excited to solve new problems and I fell in love with Web Development.
    I joined the United States Armed Forces when I was 25 as an Infantryman. It was an awesome experience but, I felt I needed to expend
    myself. The only other thing that I really wanted to do was Web Development. So, I joined Devmountain to better what little knowledge I had.
    Devmountain was a great experience and taught me the skills I needed to grow in this field. I am currently seeking employment.
